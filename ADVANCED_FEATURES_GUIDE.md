## 📈 Sold Count Estimation Methodology

### **Algorithm Factors**
1. **Watch Count Correlation** (Primary Factor)
   - Studies show 15-25% conversion rate from watchers to buyers
   - Adjusted for seller trust level and product category

2. **Bid Count Activity** (Auction Indicator)
   - High bid count indicates strong interest and likely sales
   - Weighted higher than watch count for auctions

3. **Seller Trust Metrics**
   - High feedback sellers: +30% sales boost
   - Established sellers (1000+ feedback): +10% boost
   - New sellers: -25% penalty for uncertainty

4. **Listing Type Factors**
   - Buy It Now: +20% sales likelihood (faster sales)
   - Auctions: Higher data reliability but variable conversion

5. **Price Psychology**
   - Under $20: +20% impulse purchase factor
   - Over $500: -20% consideration time factor

### **Confidence Levels**
- **High (60-85%)**: Multiple indicators available, trusted seller
- **Medium (30-60%)**: Some indicators, moderate reliability
- **Low (<30%)**: Limited data, use with caution

### **Example Calculation**
```
Product: Wireless Earbuds
- Watch Count: 25 watchers
- Seller Feedback: 2,847 (established)
- Listing Type: Buy It Now
- Price: $18.99 (impulse range)

Calculation:
- Base estimate: 25 × 0.25 = 6.25 sales
- Established seller: +10% = 6.9 sales
- Buy It Now: +20% = 8.3 sales  
- Impulse price: +20% = 10.0 sales

Result: ~10 estimated sales (High confidence)
