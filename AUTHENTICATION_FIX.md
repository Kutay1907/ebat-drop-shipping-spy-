# 🔧 Fix: "No valid eBay authentication token available"

## 🎯 The Problem
Your app is getting the error "No valid eBay authentication token available" because the environment variables are not set correctly in Railway.

## ✅ The Solution

### Step 1: Get Your eBay Credentials
1. Go to [https://developer.ebay.com/](https://developer.ebay.com/)
2. Login to your developer account
3. Go to **"My Account"** → **"Application Keysets"**
4. Find your app and copy:
   - **App ID** (this becomes `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`)
   - **Cert ID** (this becomes `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Railway
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Add these **exact** variable names:

```
EBAY_CLIENT_ID = Your_App_ID_Here
EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET = Your_Cert_ID_Here
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Variable names must be exactly as shown above!

### Step 3: Redeploy
After setting variables, you **MUST** redeploy:
- Click the **"Deploy"** button in Railway
- Or push a new commit to trigger deployment

### Step 4: Test the Fix
Test these endpoints on your deployed app:

```bash
# Check if environment variables are set
GET https://your-app.railway.app/debug/env

# Test eBay token generation
GET https://your-app.railway.app/debug/test-token

# Test search functionality
GET https://your-app.railway.app/debug/test-search
```

## 🔍 Diagnostic Tools

### Local Testing
Run this script locally to test your credentials:
```bash
python debug_auth.py
```

### Railway Testing
Use these debug endpoints on your deployed app:
- `/debug/env` - Check environment variables
- `/debug/test-token` - Test token generation
- `/debug/test-search` - Test search functionality
- `/debug/health` - Complete health check
- `/debug/troubleshooting` - Get troubleshooting info

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong Variable Names
❌ `EBAY_APP_ID`
❌ `EBAY_CERT_ID`
✅ `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`
✅ `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Issue 2: Forgot to Redeploy
Environment variables only take effect after redeployment!

### Issue 3: Wrong Credentials
- Make sure you're using **production** credentials (not sandbox)
- Verify credentials are correct in eBay Developer portal

### Issue 4: Port 5000 Error (Local Development)
If you get "Port 5000 is in use" locally:
- Disable AirPlay Receiver in System Preferences
- Or use a different port: `uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000`

## 📊 Expected Results

After fixing, you should see:
- ✅ Environment variables: `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` and `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` show as "SET"
- ✅ Token test: Shows "success" status
- ✅ Search test: Returns eBay search results
- ✅ App search: Works without "No valid eBay authentication token available" error

## 🎉 Success!
Once these steps are complete, your app should work perfectly for searching eBay products!
