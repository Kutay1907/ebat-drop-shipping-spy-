# ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway in 5 Minutes

## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository called `ebay-dropshipping-simple`
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## Step 2: Push This Folder to GitHub

```bash
cd railway-simple-app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Simple eBay Dropshipping App"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ebay-dropshipping-simple.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `ebay-dropshipping-simple` repository
5. Railway will automatically detect the Flask app and deploy it

## Step 4: Get Your URL

After deployment (takes about 2-3 minutes):
1. Click on your project in Railway
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Under "Domains", click "Generate Domain"
4. You'll get a URL like: `https://ebay-dropshipping-simple.railway.app`

## Step 5: Use in eBay Developer Program

Now you can use your Railway URL in the eBay Developer Application:

- **Application URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- **Webhook URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/webhook`
- **Privacy Policy URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app` (for now)
- **Return URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app`

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Your simple eBay dropshipping app is now live and ready to use with the eBay Developer Program.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Make sure all files are committed to GitHub
2. Check Railway logs for errors
3. Verify Python version compatibility
