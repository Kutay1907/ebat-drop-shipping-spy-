# 🚀 Deployment Options for Your eBay Scraper

## ⚠️ **Why Netlify Won't Work for This Project**

**Netlify is designed for static websites**, but your eBay scraper is a **full Python web application** that requires:

- 🐍 **Python runtime** (Netlify doesn't run Python servers)
- 🗄️ **Database operations** (SQLite with persistent storage)
- 🌐 **Long-running web server** (your Quart application)
- 🤖 **Browser automation** (Playwright with Chromium)
- ⚙️ **Server-side processing** (scraping and data analysis)

**Netlify only supports:** Static HTML/CSS/JS files + serverless functions (limited runtime)

## 🔄 **If You Really Want Static Hosting (Like Netlify)**

To deploy on Netlify, you'd need to **completely restructure** your application:

### **Required Changes:**
1. **Convert to Static Site:**
   - Remove Python backend
   - Convert to HTML/CSS/JavaScript only
   - Use client-side scraping (very limited)

2. **Use Serverless Functions:**
   - Convert scraping to Netlify Functions
   - Limited execution time (10 seconds max)
   - No persistent storage
   - No browser automation support

3. **Alternative Architecture:**
   - Static frontend (React/Vue/vanilla JS)
   - External API for data (eBay API)
   - Serverless functions for processing

**This would require rewriting 90% of your application!**
