# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Missing Dependencies

The deployment is failing because `aiosqlite` and other critical dependencies are not being installed properly.

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Force Dependency Installation

If the deployment fails again, try these steps:

1. **Check Railway Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the Railway deployment logs
2. **Verify Build Process**: Ensure the build phase is completing successfully
3. **Check Python Version**: Make sure Railway is using a compatible Python version

### 2. Alternative Deployment Commands

Try these alternative start commands in Railway:

**Option A: With dependency verification**
```bash
python deploy_verify.py && python start_production.py
```

**Option B: Minimal deployment**
```bash
python simple_deploy.py
```

**Option C: Manual dependency installation**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && python start_production.py
```

### 3. Update Railway Configuration

If the issue persists, try updating your `railway.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt && python start_production.py",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: aiosqlite Installation Fails

**Symptoms**: `aiosqlite missing` error

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the Python version supports aiosqlite
2. Try installing system dependencies first
3. Use an alternative database like SQLite3

### Issue 2: Build Timeout

**Symptoms**: Build process times out

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce the number of dependencies
2. Use a simpler requirements.txt
3. Split the build into smaller phases

### Issue 3: Python Version Compatibility

**Symptoms**: Import errors for basic packages

**Solutions**:
1. Specify Python version in nixpacks.toml
2. Use compatible package versions
3. Test locally with the same Python version

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Run Verification Script

```bash
python deploy_verify.py
```

This will show you:
- Python environment details
- Installed packages
- File system access
- Environment variables

### Step 2: Check Local Installation

Test locally to ensure dependencies work:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import aiosqlite; print('aiosqlite works')"
```

### Step 3: Simplify Requirements

If the issue persists, try a minimal `requirements.txt`:

```txt
quart==0.19.4
aiosqlite==0.19.0
pydantic==2.5.2
```

## Alternative Deployment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Docker Deployment

If Railway continues to have issues, consider using Docker:

1. Create a `Dockerfile`
2. Use Railway's Docker builder
3. Have more control over the environment

### Strategy 2: Other Platforms

Consider alternative platforms:
- **Render**: Good Python support
- **Heroku**: Mature Python deployment
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Simple deployment

### Strategy 3: Manual Server Setup

For full control:
1. Set up a VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
2. Install dependencies manually
3. Use systemd for process management

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Try the updated configuration** with the fallback deployment
2. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
3. **Run the verification script** to diagnose issues
4. **Consider minimal deployment** if full deployment fails
5. **Explore alternative platforms** if issues persist

## Contact Information

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check Railway's documentation
2. Review the error logs carefully
3. Consider the alternative deployment strategies above

## Success Metrics

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ All critical dependencies are available
- ✅ Web interface is accessible
- ✅ Database operations work
- ✅ Scraping functionality is available (if not in minimal mode)
